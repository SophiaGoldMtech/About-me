        <H1>This page is about me, Sophia Gold.</H1>
        <p>Let me tell you all about myself.</p>
        <hr/>
        <h2>I am so excited to be learning the basics of coding. I hope to go into development as a career.</h2>
        <p>I've been looking into web development for probably a year now. <br/> It's exciting to finally get into it and really commit. </p>
        <h3>My hobbies are all over the place. I can't pick one and stick with it haha. <br/> No Hobbies &lt; Too Many Hobbies &gt; None Hobbies </h3>
        <p>But if I had to pick one to do for the rest of my life, it would be an incredible toss up between <br/> MOUNTAIN BIKING or <br/> PAINTING</p>
        <hr/>
        <p>I think my favorite part about a career in development is that there will always be more to learn. Always ways to improve myself and grow my skillset. </p>
        <p>Even if you master one language there's probably a million more you haven't even started looking at.</p>
        <span>Not to mention</span>
        <span>there are so many ways</span>
        <span>to solve so many problems.</span>
        <pre>There is really no right way or wrong way a lot of the time. &lt;For example, I just learned that these character entity reference's exist.&gt;</pre>
        <p>But at the same time I could just put these here < > < > < > < > < > </p>
        <P>They're definetely uglier but either way it get the point across.</P>
